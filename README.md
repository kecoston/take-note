  ## Instillation 
  This application requires express, fs, and path

  ## User-Story 
  The user first needs to open the application in node and install all programs by running an npm install. Once that is completed, the user can run the server.js file in node. Once it runs, the application will be connected to a server and the user can open the localhost in their browser.

  Once they arrive on the homescreen they can click on the 'get started' button to be directed to the notepad page. From here they will see two input fields where they can add the name of the note, and leave their remarks for the note below.

  When they have completed the note, they may then click on the save icon in the upper right corner. When the user refreshes the page, they will see their previous notes saved on the righthand side. They can either open the note by clicking on it, or delete the note if they are done with it.

  ## What I Learned from this Assignment 

  I found having the ablitiy to create data, store it to a file, and being able to move that data around very exciting. I spent a lot of time reviewing fs. write, read, and append for this class. From this activity I have a better understanding of how to work with JSON objects. What helped me this most with this activity was the ability to talk through the code with another person, this really helped me to troubleshoot, and plan out how to move forward.
